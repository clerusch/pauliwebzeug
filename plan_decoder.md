We have pauliwebs, so what are steps we need?
- Brute force by going through all syndrome combos
- Find a triggering single-edge error for each syndrome
- Find the correction for it
- dongles for firing edges, adapt get_detection_webs() for 
- connecting arbitrary edges (for finding error propagation through circuit)
- -> get a dictionary of corrections from syndromes
- -> scale to arbitrary numbers of iterations of syndrome rounds
- make func to create zx dist-presv rewrite graphs from stabilizers
- think about decoding translation through dist-preserving rewrites
- commuting of logical operations through encoding diagrams
-
