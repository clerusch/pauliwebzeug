We have pauliwebs, so what are steps we need?
- Type out QEC code into stim.
- Create a tanner graph of pauliwebs (isnt this shit though, they all share one edge after all??)
- On a more macro level: Which predictions are *actually* equivalent? What does it mean for two errors to be equivalent? Does that matter? (maybe a theory of spider webs)
