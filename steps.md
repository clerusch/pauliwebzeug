# Next steps for the steane style steane 4 rounds
- show the recs, to make a new add_detectors for it
- How can i do this programatically? Doing it by hand suuuucks -.-
- We may have some issues with the designating of nodes as outputs/(maybe also inputs?)
    - Nope, this is fine because we dont want those to fire anyways
    - Although remember that only actual outputs need to be named, ancillas dont!
    - Still strange that the last measurement block does not have any incident web. 
        - Weird boundary stuff happening?
